## **On Interdisciplinary Research: A Note to Visitors**

> **Why does this project span so many fields?**

Because information is the universal language of nature.
Whether in financial markets, genomics, seismic waves, physiology, oil detection, or physical systems, the *fundamental challenge* is the same:
**discovering structure, predictability, and transitions in complex data.**

**SKA (Structured Knowledge Accumulation)** is a general information geometry framework, designed to work on any sequential, streaming, or high-dimensional data—regardless of the scientific domain.
That’s why you’ll find applications across finance, physics, biology, medicine, earth science, and engineering throughout this repository.

> **Who is behind this work?**
>
> My background is in theoretical and computational physics, but my career and curiosity have always crossed boundaries—because real-world problems rarely fit neatly into a single discipline.
>
> The vision of this project is to **demonstrate that universal principles of information structure, learning, and predictability unite the sciences**—and to provide tools that make those principles practical for everyone.
