 **Why does QUANTIOTA span so many fields?**

 Because *information* is the common thread that weaves through all of nature.
 From financial markets and genomics to seismology, physiology, oil detection, physics, and fluid dynamics—the ultimate challenge is the same:
 **Revealing hidden structure, predictability, and transitions in complex data.**

 
At QUANTIOTA, we believe—like John Archibald Wheeler—that the ultimate foundation of reality is information:

“It from bit. Every item of the physical world has at bottom... an immaterial source and explanation; reality arises... from the posing of yes–no questions and the registering of equipment–evoked responses; in short, all things physical are information-theoretic in origin and this is a participatory universe.”
— J.A. Wheeler, Foundations of Quantum Mechanics, Tokyo, 1989




 **Structured Knowledge Accumulation (SKA)** is our unifying framework for information geometry.
 It empowers real-time, unsupervised learning and discovery across *any* sequential, streaming, or high-dimensional data—regardless of discipline.

 **At QUANTIOTA, we believe universal information principles can unlock new insights everywhere.**

 Our organization welcomes all researchers, engineers, and innovators—across domains—who share this vision.
