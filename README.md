## **QUANTIOTA: Unifying Science Through Information**

**Why does QUANTIOTA span so many fields?**

Because *information* is the common thread that weaves through all of nature. From financial markets and genomics to seismology, physiology, oil detection, physics, and fluid dynamics—the ultimate challenge is the same:
**Revealing hidden structure, predictability, and transitions in complex data.**

**Structured Knowledge Accumulation (SKA)** is our unifying framework for information geometry.
It empowers real-time, unsupervised learning and discovery across any sequential, streaming, or high-dimensional data—regardless of discipline.

At QUANTIOTA, we believe—like John Archibald Wheeler—that the ultimate foundation of reality is information:

> *“It from bit symbolizes the idea that every item of the physical world has at bottom—a very deep bottom, in most instances—an immaterial source and explanation; that what we call reality arises in the last analysis from the posing of yes-no questions and the registering of equipment-evoked responses; in short, that all things physical are information-theoretic in origin and this is a participatory universe.”*
> — John Archibald Wheeler, “Information, Physics, Quantum: The Search for Links” (1989, 1990)

Our organization welcomes all researchers, engineers, and innovators—across domains—who share this vision.
